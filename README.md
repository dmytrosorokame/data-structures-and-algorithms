# Data Structures and Algorithms

This repository contains implementations of various data structures and algorithms in JavaScript.<br>
This repository was created during my completing of Udemy course [Data Structures and Algorithms](https://www.udemy.com/course/data-structures-algorithms-javascript/).<br>
As result â€“ I've learned basics of data structures and algorithms and got a [Certificate](https://www.udemy.com/certificate/UC-bd1e21c8-c01f-4ebd-9c34-da2133e0e088/) of completion.
